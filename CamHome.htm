			This page is dedicated to our son, Cameron.  He was born January 16th, 2013, at 35 weeks' gestation, due to complications with his mother's health and the umbilical cord being wrapped around his neck.  He weighed 4 lbs, 13.9 oz at birth, and was 16.5 inches in length.  One of the first things we noticed about him was the marked deformity of both his feet.  He was later diagnosed with a condition known as <a href="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00612">congenital vertical talus</a>, where the bones of his mid-foot are misaligned, causing the feet to flex upward toward the front of the leg.  This condition is extremely rare outside of a genetic syndrome.  After a week spent in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, he was pronounced otherwise healthy.  His feet were surgically repaired at the age of three months at <a href="http://www.nemours.org">Nemours Children's Hospital</a> in Orlando, Florida.</p>  <p>Cameron did well following the surgery, but was delayed in his physical milestones, including crawling and walking.  As time went on, he also fell farther behind on his growth milestones, leading to a renewed search for a unifying diagnosis.</p>  <p>After months of testing, an MRI of his brain revealed the answer.  Cameron was diagnosed with a condition known as a Chiari Malformation.  Click <a href="AboutChiari.htm">here</a> for further information on this condition.  Cameron went back under the knife for brain surgery to correct this issue.  Following this procedure, Cameron has advanced leaps and bounds.  He is now walking, talking, and making great strides in height and weight gains.  Our son is blossoming in front of our eyes thanks to the wonderful people at Nemours Children's Hospital. </p>
